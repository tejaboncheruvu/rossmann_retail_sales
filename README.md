Rossmann, one of the largest drug store chains in Europe, operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Rossmann store managers are asked to predict their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by several factors, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasona, locality, etc. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the results are not accurate.

The data provided contains information about historical sales of 1,115 Rossmann stores. Some stores are temporarily closed for refurbishment. The problem here is to build an ML model to forecast the sales of stores.

The goal is to analyse the historical data of the stores to get actionable insights and predict the sales of each Rossmann store. The predictions can be used by the store managers and the marketing teams to plan things in advance and improve their performance.
